FogOfWeb is a nyfty little python script that will generate random internet browsing data. 

This was created with the intention to throw up a smoke screen for the ISPs that are trying to sell your data. 

It immitates a browser and can go to HTTP and HTTPS sites. 

It will randomly try links on the page and go down the rabbit hole. 

The list of URLs can be changed to anything you like. It is recommended you put URLs you are never likely to visit. 

Then just run it with a random URL ID and watch the magic happen. 

It will run as long as you let it run.
